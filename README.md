# Tourism-Package-Prediction-using-Python
Context: The policymaker of a tourism company named "Elysian Adventures" wants to establish a business model to expand the customer base, to understand the existing ways of doing the business and how to change the ways for the benefit of the tourism sector.
One of the ways to expand the customer base is to introduce a new offering of packages. Currently, there are 5 types of packages the company is offering - Basic, Standard, Deluxe, Super Deluxe, and King. Looking at the data of the last year, it was observed that 18% of the customers purchased the packages. However, it was difficult to identify the potential customers because customers were contacted at random without looking at the available information.
The company is now planning to launch a new product i.e. Relaxation Tour Package. Relaxation Tour is a package that allows the traveler to maintain, enhance, or kick-start a healthy lifestyle, and support or increase one's sense of well-being. For the launch of the new package, the company wants to harness the available data of existing and potential customers to target the right customers.


Objective: I as a Data Scientist at "Elysian Adventures" travel company has to analyze the customer data and information to provide recommendations to the policymaker and build a model to predict the chances of a potential customer purchasing the newly introduced travel package before the customer is contacted.
